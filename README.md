## 🚀 About Prism

Prism began as a one‑day project to solve a simple, practical problem: frontend UI/UX designers and developers often need quick inspiration from other websites — accurate color palettes and full‑page screenshots to study color usage and layout. I built Prism to make that workflow trivial.

Designed specifically for UI/UX practitioners, Prism captures the **entire page** (including areas outside the viewport) and runs an offscreen, locally executed color analysis that quantizes and clusters similar shades. Think "Site Palette, but better" — for inspiration see https://palette.site. Prism is free, open‑source, and focuses on full‑page captures and local palette extraction to help people who "just can't get the right colours" find visual inspiration quickly.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Full-Page Capture**: Uses Chrome DevTools Protocol for pixel-perfect full-page screenshots.
- 🎨 **Smart Palette Extraction**: Extracts dominant colors using quantization and clustering to merge similar shades.
- 🔒 **Privacy Focused**: Option to extract the palette _without_ saving the screenshot to your disk.
- 💅 **Minimalist UI**: Clean popup interface and a non-intrusive on-page overlay.
- ⚡ **Floating Action Button**: Automatically appears when you scroll to the bottom of a page.
- 💾 **Export Ready**: Copy individual hex codes or download the full palette as JSON.

## 📦 Installation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Manifest V3**: Future-proof Chrome Extension architecture.
